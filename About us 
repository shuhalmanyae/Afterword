The Headline
The Afterword: Because "Goodbye" Shouldn't Be An Accident.

1. The Philosophy
The Unfinished Symphony.

We spend our entire lives curating our narrative. We archive our photos, we meticulously organize our careers, and we secure our homes. We plan for weddings five years out and retirement thirty years away. Yet, for the one certainty that awaits us all, we often leave nothing but silence.

In the digital age, passing away is no longer just physical; it is administrative. It is chaotic. It is a sudden loss of access to the memories, assets, and words that defined you.

We built Afterword because we believe the final chapter of your life shouldn't be written by a lawyer, or guessed at by a grieving relative. It should be written by you.

2. The Capabilities
More Than Just Text.

Emotion is not just ink on paper. It is the sound of a laugh, the look in an eye, the memory of a face. Afterword is built to handle the full spectrum of your legacy.

The Voice: Record a final lullaby, a joke, or a piece of advice.

The Vision: Upload video messages for specific milestones or simple goodbyes.

The Archives: Attach photos, documents, and digital keys.

You can assign these to as many people as you wish. Whether it is one final letter to your partner or fifty individual notes to every friend you’ve ever made, the capacity is yours to define.

3. The Promise
The Relentless Delivery Protocol.

We are not just an automated email server. We are your digital executors.

Most systems fire an email into the void and hope it lands. We do not hope. We verify. Our system tracks every single dispatch—email or SMS. We know if a message was opened, and more importantly, we know if it wasn't.

The "Priority" Safety Net: If an email bounces, a phone number is disconnected, or a message remains unopened, our system flags it as "Priority Status." At this stage, automation ends, and humanity begins. Our team initiates a manual protocol to locate your intended beneficiary and ensure they receive what you left for them. We do not stop until the message is delivered.

4. The Mechanism
How It Works: The Dead Man’s Switch.

The logic is simple, brutal, and effective.

You Write: You draft your messages today, while you are sound of mind and heart.

We Verify: Our system periodically checks for your presence—a pulse in the digital void.

We Wait: If you miss a check-in, and your trusted verifiers confirm the silence, the timer begins.

We Release: Once the condition is met, the vault opens.

5. The Swiss Guarantee
Why Switzerland?

Trust is not a vibe; in our world, it is geography.

We are headquartered in Switzerland for a reason. Your data is protected by the strictest privacy laws on Earth. 

Your secrets die with you—unless you choose to share them.

6. The Call to Action
Don't Leave Them Guessing.

It takes 5 minutes to secure a lifetime of memories. The cost of a coffee for peace of mind forever.
