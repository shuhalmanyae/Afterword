Let's build the **Dashboard** (The Vault) at `/dashboard`. While keeping the main design as elegent as the homepage. 

**Design Concept:** "Swiss Bank Safe Deposit Box."
* **Theme:** Dark mode, minimalist, high contrast (Silver/Grey on Black).
* **Layout:** 3-Column Grid (responsive).

**Column 1: Beneficiaries**
* List of contacts (Name + Email).
* "Add New Contact" button.

**Column 2: The Assets (Main Feed)**
* Display a list of "Digital Envelopes" (Cards).
* Each card shows:
    * Type Icon (Text, Audio, Video).
    * Title (e.g., "For Sarah").
    * Status Badge (Draft / Secured).
* **Input Area:** A clean input box at the top: "Leave a message..." with attachment icons.

**Column 3: Security Status**
* **Pulse Indicator:** Green dot ("Monitoring Active").
* **Next Check:** Date display.
* **Guest Logic:** If `user_is_guest` is true, show a "14-Day Deletion Countdown" and a "Secure Now ($4.99)" button.

**Tech Stack:**
* Use `lucide-react` for icons (Lock, Mic, Video, User).
* Use a 'Masonry' or 'Grid' layout for the messages.
